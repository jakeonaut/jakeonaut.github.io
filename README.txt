# LOL nevermind i forgot to do this and edited the files directly oh well


## DO NOT MODIFY HTML FILES DIRECTLY! Instead, modify templates/ and run the 
## proper generation script (see below)

To generate site from templates, install python3 and make sure "python" and 
    "pip" are in your path.

Install necessary python packages:
  ~ pip install jinja2

And run the python script!
  ~ python run.py
