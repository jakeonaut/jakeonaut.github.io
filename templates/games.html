            Made for
            <a href="http://jams.gamejolt.io/glitchjam">GameJolt's 2014 Glitch Jam</a>. It took second place overall!
            <br/><br/>
            My most popular game to date, with over <strong><i>25,000</i></strong> unique plays!
            I've even had <a href="http://mrfxinc.tumblr.com/post/97596460236/amazing-i-still-love-glitch-dungeon-and-im">

        <h2>goblin catcher:</h2>
        The first graphical game I ever made! It was based off of <a href="http://www.lostdecadegames.com/how-to-make-a-simple-html5-canvas-game/">
        this great HTML5/JavaScript tutorial!</a>
        <br/><br/>
        And I got to the top of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/w8hfx/my_first_graphical_game_finished_in/">gamedev subreddit</a> for a 
        little while (I was so excited!!).

        My first foray into <strong>boss battles...</strong> and last!

          an <strong><i>idle</i></strong> game I made for

          inspired by pokemon and neopets, I made it using stolen digimon sprites.

        more of an experiment with programmatic land and <strong>sound 
        generation</strong> than a game, really.

        a classic <strong>zelda arcade clone</strong>: complete with "borrowed" sprites and music

          a very obtuse <strong>text adventure</strong> game I made originally in python :)
          <br/><br/>
          After many complaints, I have made a <a href="./walkthrough.html" ><strong>
          spoiler-free walkthrough</strong></a> to aid in playthrough.

        Another one of my more experimental titles, this went through several
        iterations where it was more like a <strong>digital piano</strong> than 
        an actual game. 
        <br/><br/>
        Some core ideas would eventually be present in <i>"echo island"</i> above.

        One of the first large scale game projects I worked on. Although I never 
        finished it, I've included old mockups and assets here. <br/><br/>
        The <strong>color changing</strong> mechanic would eventually become a 
        core mechanic of <i>"glitch dungeon"</i> above.

        <h2>summer game/spirit eggs:</h2>
        A very ambitious title I intended to make one summer. Combining elements
        of zelda, cave story, and pokemon, I have more ".txt" file ideas than I
        do actual gameplay.
        <br/><br/>
        Core mechanics were eventually used in <i>"the monkey king"</i> above.

        Several ideas/assets eventually made there way into finished projects
